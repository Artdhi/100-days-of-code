# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 3, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started my first challenge on FreeCodeCamp, setting up my Github account. I just finished the basic HTML and HTML5 on https://www.freecodecamp.org/

**Thoughts:** It is actually quite fun learning HTML and HTML5 on https://www.freecodecamp.org/ . I thought that 1 hour learn to code is easy but actually it isn't but still exciting learning how to code.
